# Pedestrian Detection and Traffic Simulation Repository

## Overview
This repository hosts a collection of simulation and analysis projects primarily focused on traffic systems and pedestrian dynamics, all implemented in Java and Java Swing. Each project within this repository utilizes these technologies to explore different aspects of auto and pedestrian traffic simulation.

### Projects Included:
- **FreeWayTraffic1 & FreeWayTraffic2**: These projects are simulators of freeway traffic scenarios designed to study the behavior of vehicular flow and its impact on traffic density and efficiency. They provide a visual simulation environment built using Java Swing to model and analyze freeway traffic patterns.
- **GameOfLife**: An implementation of Conway's Game of Life. This project is a cellular automaton simulation used to observe the evolution of cellular structures over time, programmed in Java.
- **GolombRulers**: A study and implementation of Golomb Rulers in Java, an interesting mathematical problem often applied in fields such as error detection and correction within digital communication systems.
- **Pedestrians**: A core project dedicated to pedestrian detection in video feeds, useful in traffic management and urban planning. This utilizes advanced image processing techniques in Java to identify and track pedestrian movement.
- **SoundWave**: An analytical tool built in Java Swing that simulates the propagation of sound waves in different environments to study acoustic properties and phenomena.
